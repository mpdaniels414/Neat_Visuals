# Bird Migration Visualization

This project uses the `bird_migration.csv` dataset provided by [Turhan Can Kargin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/turhancankargin/bird-migration) to visualize bird migration paths. The `mapview` package in R is utilized to create interactive maps, enabling a detailed exploration of bird movement patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset, `bird_migration.csv`, contains information on bird migration paths, including latitude, longitude, and timestamps of observations. It is sourced from:

### Key Columns in the Dataset
- `latitude`: Latitude of the bird's location.
- `longitude`: Longitude of the bird's location.
- `timestamp`: Date and time of the observation.

## Objective

- Visualize bird migration paths using the `mapview` package in R.
- Create interactive maps to analyze bird movement patterns.
- Save the generated maps as HTML files for easy sharing and offline exploration.
