# Neat_Visuals

Welcome to **Neat_Visuals**! This repository is a collection of stunning visuals created using R's `globalearth` and other related packages. It's a space to showcase the beauty of data visualization and mapping.

## About

This repository serves as a gallery of neat visuals I've been able to create using R. While I may include snippets of code here and there, the primary focus is on preserving and sharing the visuals themselves. Whether you're here for inspiration, learning, or just to admire some cool graphics, I hope you enjoy exploring these creations!

## Tools Used

- **R**: The main language used for data manipulation and visualization.
- **mapview**: The main package used for visualizing the data.  

## Features

- A collection of unique and visually appealing graphics.
- Examples of how data can be transformed into interactive and meaningful visualizations.
- Potential code snippets to recreate or adapt similar visuals.

## Why This Repository?

Creating and sharing visuals is a passion of mine, and I wanted a dedicated space to store and showcase these works. It's also a way to look back at the progress I've made and the creativity unleashed through R's powerful visualization tools.
